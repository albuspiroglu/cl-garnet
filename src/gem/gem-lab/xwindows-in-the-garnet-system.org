* X11 -- The good parts

  
** The X11 model

   The X11 system was developed in the early 80s at a time when
   bit-mapped desplays were still a relatively new phenominon.
   Earlier graphic systems, such as the Apollo or Lisp Machine systems
   started with a very definite, primitive conception of a graphical
   environment that included such things as mice, keyboards, monitors,
   processes, etc.  As each system evolved, the tendancy was for the
   graphic system to become more and more general as it needed to
   accomidate additional hardware conficgurations, and program use
   cases.
